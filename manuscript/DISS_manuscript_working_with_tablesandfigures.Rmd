abstract: |
  Maladaptive responses to peer acceptance and rejection arise in numerous psychiatric disorders in adolescence; yet homogeneity and heterogeneity across disorders suggests common and unique mechanisms of impaired social function. We tested the hypothesis that social feedback is processed similarly to other forms of feedback (e.g., monetary) by examining the correspondence between the brain’s response to social acceptance and rejection and behavioral performance on a separate reward and loss task. We also examined the relationship between these brain responses and depression and social anxiety severity. The sample consisted of 113 16–21-year-olds who received virtual peer acceptance/rejection feedback in an event-related potential (ERP) task. We used temporospatial principal component analysis and identified a component consistent with the reward positivity (RewP) or feedback negativity (FN). RewP to social acceptance was not significantly related to reward bias nor the FN to social rejection related to loss avoidance. The relationship between RewP and depression severity, while non-significant, was of a similar magnitude to prior studies. Exploratory analyses yielded a significant relationship between lower socioeconomic status (SES) and blunted RewP, and between lower SES and heightened loss avoidance and blunted reward bias. These findings build on prior work to improve our understanding of the function of the brain’s response to social feedback, while also suggesting a pathway for further study, whereby poverty leads to depression via social and reward learning mechanisms.

# 1. Introduction

Problems forming and maintaining interpersonal relationships are a central feature of  numerous psychiatric disorders [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013; @kennedySocialBrainPsychiatric2012]. Responding properly to social feedback is a key element of adaptive and effective social function. Beyond psychiatric impairments, such problems are also  associated with physical health problems and increased mortality risk [@houseSocialRelationshipsHealth1988]. Here, social feedback refers to the receipt of socially relevant information (e.g., being accepted or rejected by a conspecific). Individuals must use such feedback to learn and alter their behavior, and respond in a prosocial manner that elicits the desired response in another person. Clinically, patients with a variety of psychological disorders often present with complaints of dysfunction in their interpersonal relationships, resulting in, for example, withdrawal or avoidance of social situations and thus social isolation [@brownWhenNeedBelong2007; @rubinSocialWithdrawalChildhood2009]. There is increased interest in the psychological and neural processes involved in responding to social feedback (i.e., acceptance and rejection), and how such disruptions manifest across different disorders. Thus, one aim of the current study was to assess shared and unique alterations in  responses to social feedback in depression and anxiety.

Recent studies of social feedback have suggested that the brain responds to acceptance much like monetary rewards  [@distefanoComparisonElectrocorticalResponse2018; @guLoveAnalogousMoney2019; @wakeCommonNeuralCode2017]. A long literature has used monetary rewards to study reward processes such as reward learning [e.g., @delgadoRewardRelatedResponsesHuman2007; @haberRewardCircuitLinking2010], since money is universal and easy to titrate. However, it remains unclear how this paradigm translates to other types of rewards. In fact, other studies have shown weak relationships between brain responses to social and monetary feedback [@ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017; but see @distefanoComparisonElectrocorticalResponse2018], differential responses depending on participants’ age  [@rademacherDifferentialPatternsNucleus2014], or differential relationships as a function of prior peer victimization  [@rappaportPeerVictimizationDysfunctional2019]. Furthermore, social feedback may prove more salient and ecologically valid in the study of psychopathology, given that different types of psychopathology involve disruptions in interpersonal relationships and reduced social engagement. Individual differences in responding to *social* stimuli may be able to explain homogeneity and heterogeneity between commonly co-occurring disorders (e.g., depression and social anxiety).

Behaviorally, depression and social anxiety can lead to the same behavioral consequence but for different reasons. For instance, individuals may withdraw from social interactions because they experience less pleasure from interacting with other people, out of fear of rejection (or negative evaluation more generally), or for both reasons [see @rubinSocialWithdrawalChildhood2009 for a review]. Such heterogeneity and homogeneity across disorders suggests both common and unique mechanisms of impaired interpersonal relationships. Homogeneity is exemplified by multiple disorders sharing deficits. For example, both depression and social anxiety are associated with heightened sensitivity to social rejection [@burklundNeuralResponsesSocial2017; @cohenRejectionSensitivityTransdiagnostic2016; @gaoAssociationsRejectionSensitivity2017; @groschwitzDifferentialNeuralProcessing2016; @harrewijnBehavioralEEGResponses2017; @heerenCorrelatesSocialExclusion2017; @hsuItStillHurts2015; @kujawaElectrocorticalReactivitySocial2014; @malejkoNeuralCorrelatesSocial2018; @silkIncreasedNeuralResponse2014], but only depression, not social anxiety [@kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019], is associated with blunted neural responses to social acceptance and inclusion [@daveyIncreasedAmygdalaResponse2011; @kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017; @zhangDullSocialAcceptance2017; @zhangDifferentiatingAbnormalitiesSocial2020].

Studying the neural processes associated with social feedback can help us understand whether these similar behavioral outcomes (i.e., reduced time spent with others) are due to common or distinct psychophysiological mechanisms. That is, although these two dimensions of psychopathology (anxiety and depression) are related to deficits in responding to social feedback, they may do so via both shared and distinct mechanisms, guiding more individualized treatments. Although such deficits could be evaluated in a clinical interview, using self and informant reports, this carries limitations such as method bias, self-presentation biases, and reliance on reporter insight  [@campbellConvergentDiscirminantValidation1959; @podsakoffCommonMethodBiases2003]. Furthermore, brain measures can tap into implicit differences in individuals' response to social feedback, such as attentional biases [@silkPeerAcceptanceRejection2012]. Thus, neural measures may serve to complement other measures of symptoms to inform more individualized treatments (e.g., exposure and habituation to social rejection, pairing reinforcements with social acceptance). To test such hypotheses, transdiagnostic studies are needed to distinguish common from unique neural and behavioral deficits in social feedback response across psychiatric disorders.

To test hypotheses about the psychological processes implicated in the response to social feedback, observational studies thus far have typically correlated individual differences in brain responses and self-reported symptoms. These have begun to highlight deficits in responding to social acceptance and rejection in depression [@kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019; @zhangDullSocialAcceptance2017] and social anxiety [@caoUnexpectedAcceptancePatients2015; @guNeuralCorrelatesNegative2020; @harrewijnBehavioralEEGResponses2018; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019; see @rappaportBrainResponsesSocial2020 for a review]. The NIMH RDoC's initiative [@cuthbertRDoCFrameworkFacilitating2014; @inselResearchDomainCriteria2010; @NIMHDefinitionsRDoC] proposes that multiple levels of analysis (e.g., brain, behavior, self-report) ought to converge within domains (e.g., positive valence, negative valence). Comparing brain responses to social feedback to behavioral reward learning can test the extent to which deficits in responding to social acceptance are due to a widespread general deficit in reward or something else. Existing studies comparing brain responses to social and monetary feedback suggest that blunted responding to social acceptance is distinct from blunted responding to monetary gains [e.g., @ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017; @rappaportPeerVictimizationDysfunctional2019, but see @distefanoComparisonElectrocorticalResponse2018]. Here, we take these analyses a step further, by assessing whether multiple levels of analyses show convergence. The presence of convergence would indicate that, even despite multi-method variance, aberrant responding to social feedback is at least partially a consequence of aberrant general reward system dysfunction. The absence of convergence would provide fruitful avenues for future research.

Within the brain, the neural systems that process and respond to social feedback involve a host of brain regions that work in a coordinated fashion, just as any other social function [@amodioCanNeuroscienceAdvance2010]. FMRI studies have identified regions active in response to social exclusion [@cacioppoQuantitativeMetaAnalysisFunctional2013; @vijayakumarNeuralCorrelatesSocial2017]. In complementary research, event-related potentials (ERPs)---time-locked EEG signals---provide a robust way to understand the timing of neural responses associated with social feedback by examining specific ERP components thought to reflect brain activity to acceptance (reward positivity [RewP]) and rejection [feedback negativity [FN], @luckOxfordHandbookEventRelated2012; @proudfitRewardPositivityBasic2015; @reganHumanBrianElectrophysiology1989]. Given the complexity of brain responses to social feedback, the temporal resolution of ERP is well suited to identifying individual differences in brain responses as compared to methods with worse temporal but better spatial resolution [@amodioTrackingDynamicsSocial2014]. Moreover, ERPs directly measure brain activity [@grattonSheddingLightBrain2001], rather than its indirect consequence with a hemodynamic response in fMRI. These factors together suggest that ERP is an excellent method for measuring individual differences in brain responsivity to social feedback.

## 1.1 Current study

The current study aims to address the key questions outlined above. Specifically, first we test the psychological processes implicated in responding to social feedback, by testing the relationship between individual differences in a) RewP and FN magnitude to social acceptance and rejection feedback, and b) separate behavioral individual differences of bias towards rewards and away from losses. Hypothesis 1 then, for this aim, is that individual differences in the RewP to social acceptance will be positively related to behavioral reward bias, and similarly that individual differences in the FN to social rejection will be positively related to behavioral loss avoidance. Second, we test diagnostic homogeneity and heterogeneity by analyzing the relationship between individual differences in a) RewP and FN magnitude to social acceptance and rejection feedback, and b) severity of depression and social anxiety symptoms. Hypothesis 2 is that the RewP to acceptance will be negatively related to depression severity, and that the FN to rejection will be positively related to depression and social anxiety severity. Third, we test for the presence of a relationship between a) behavioral bias towards rewards and away from losses, and b) severity of depression and social anxiety, aiding in the interpretation of the previous analyses. This would provide converging evidence of our proposed nomological network between the ERP, behavioral, and psychopathology measures. Thus, hypothesis 3 is that behavioral reward bias will be negatively related to depression severity, and that behavioral loss avoidance will be positively related to depression and social anxiety severity. Finally, exploratory analyses examine three other areas that may prove fruitful for further research. First, we examine relationships between these variables of interest and covariates known to be associated with risk for psychopathology, such as socioeconomic status. Second, we also examine other ERP components identified with PCA. For example, prior studies have identified N1 and P2 components [@babinskiSensitivityPeerFeedback2018; @peggTimeCourseReactivity2022]. The N1 is an early negative, frontal, waveform thought to reflect early attention salience, showing larger amplitudes to emotionally salient stimuli [@fotiDifferentiatingNeuralResponses2009a; @keilEffectsEmotionalArousal2001; @kisslerEmotionAttentionVisual2009; @vogelVisualN1Component2000]. The P2 is an early, positive, frontocentral waveform thought to reflect selective attention, particularly to emotional stimuli [@hajcakERPsStudyEmotion2012; @luckElectrophysiologicalCorrelatesFeature1994]. Third, we examine relationships between the RewP and FN and behavioral acceptance and rejection patterns (i.e. participants' tendency to accept or reject co-players).

# 2. Methods

## 2.1 Participants

Participants were drawn from the Preschool Depression Study (PDS), a prospective longitudinal investigation of young children and their families conducted at a Midwestern university in the United States [@lubyPreschoolDepressionHomotypic2009]. Details of recruitment have been previously reported [@lubyPreschoolDepressionHomotypic2009; @lubyTrajectoriesPreschoolDisorders2014]. To briefly summarize, 3- to 6-year-old children were recruited from primary care practices and preschools/daycares throughout the St. Louis metropolitan region using a validated screening checklist [Preschool Feelings Checklist [PFC], @lubyPreschoolFeelingsChecklist2004] to over-sample preschoolers with symptoms of depression and healthy controls (i.e., those whose caregivers endorsed no items on the PFC, two or more internalizing items, and/or two or more externalizing items). Children were excluded if they presented with chronic illness, marked speech and/or language delays and/or neurologic or autism spectrum disorders. Parental written consent and child assent were obtained before participation and the local Institutional Review Board approved all procedures. These 306 children have participated in up to 10 in person clinical and behavior assessments and five neuroimaging assessments. An additional 40 currently healthy children were added at school age and have participated in up to five clinical and behavior assessments and five neuroimaging assessments. Participants completed all measures of the current study during the tenth and most recent assessment wave of the PDS. Of those, 175 participated in the most recent wave, with 118 participants completing the social feedback task. Of those, one participant was excluded due to technical errors during the social feedback task, and two participants were excluded due to intelligence quotients (IQ) below 70. Of those `r sum(complete.cases(DISS_do02$rewp_r))` remaining participants, `r sum((DISS_do02$Subid)<499)` had participated since preschool age, and `r sum((DISS_do02$Subid)>499)` were recruited as healthy controls at the later wave of the study. Furthermore, `r sum(complete.cases(DISS_do02$Reward_bias_20))` had completed and had usable data for the behavioral reward task and `r sum(complete.cases(DISS_do02$Loss_bias_20))` for the loss task, `r sum(complete.cases(DISS_do02$S5cdic_bdi_perc))` had completed a self-report measure of depression, and `r sum(complete.cases(DISS_do02$S5_SIASSPS))` had completed a self-report measure of social anxiety. The final analytical sample contained `r length(DISS_do02_nooutliers$Subid)` after `r length(rows_to_exclude)` participants were excluded as outliers (see below). See Table 1 for demographic characteristics of the study sample. Of note, the current study sample included data from 54 participants previously reported [@rappaportPeerVictimizationDysfunctional2019].

### 2.2.1 Depression severity

Depression severity was measured using the Children's Depression Inventory--2 [CDI-2, @kovacsChildrenDepressionInventory1992] for participants less than 18 years-old and Beck Depression Inventory--II [BDI--II, @dozoisPsychometricEvaluationBeck1998] for participants 18 years-old and older. The CDI-2 includes 28 items scored on a three point Likert scale. The BDI-II includes 21 items scored on a four point Likert scale. Both measures assess self-reported depression symptoms in the past 2 weeks and have excellent internal consistency in the current sample (CDI-2: $\alpha$ = 0.90; BDI-II: $\alpha$ = `r myround(bdi_ic$total$std.alpha,2)`) and test-retest reliability in prior studies [CDI-2: $r$ = 0.89, BDI-II: $r$ = 0.93, @beckBeckDepressionInventoryII1996; @dozoisPsychometricEvaluationBeck1998; @kovacsChildrenDepressionInventory1992]. See Table 2 for means and standard deviations. Of note, scores were computed as the percentage of the maximum possible score on each scale (i.e., 63 for the BDI--II and 56 for the CDI-2) to make them comparable between subjects.

### 2.2.2 Social anxiety severity

Social anxiety severity was measured using the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS-6) and Social Phobia Scale [SPS-6, @petersDevelopmentShortForm2012]---a scale that combines the two scales and was developed as an abbreviated version of the full SIAS/SPS [@mattickDevelopmentValidationMeasures1998] using Item Response Theory modeling. This scale includes six items rated on a five point Likert scale from each of the SIAS-6 and SPS-6, comprising one total 12 item scale. The SIAS/SPS-6 assesses self-reported current symptoms of social anxiety/phobia (with no specific time frame given) and has excellent internal consistency in the current sample ($\alpha$ = `r myround(sias_sps_ic$total$std.alpha,2)`) and test-retest reliability in prior studies [$r$ \> 0.91, @mattickDevelopmentValidationMeasures1998; @osmanSocialPhobiaSocial1998]. See Table 2 for means and standard deviations.

### 2.2.3 Covariates

Covariates in multiple regression models included age at time of task, sex, race (Caucasian, African American, or Multiracial), Hispanic ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, operationalized as income-to-needs ratio (i.e., total family income divided by the federal poverty level, based on family size). Income-to-needs ratio from the most recent available assessment wave was used. Supplemental analyses also included recent psychotropic medicine use as a covariate, however `r as.english(sum(!complete.cases(DISS_do02$S5psychmed_dos_f)))` participants were missing this data and thus were excluded from analyses when this covariate was included. All categorical variables (i.e., sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and psychotropic medicine use) were dummy coded and all continuous variables (i.e., reward bias, loss avoidance, RewP, FN, depression severity, social anxiety severity, age, socioeconomic status) were standardized to aid in interpretation of regression estimates.

## 2.3 Procedure

### 2.3.1 Social feedback ERP task

The Island Getaway task was used to measure brain responses to social feedback (for task see github.com/Kodiologist/Survivor/tree/barch). For the task, participants are told they are playing a game with 11 co-players (who are actually not real but whose voting behavior is programmed in the task) in which they are traveling in the Hawaiian Islands, and at each island, vote whether they want each co-player to continue on with them to the next island, followed by feedback on how co-players voted for them. Participants review information about each co-player (e.g., gender, location, personal preferences) and enter information that they are told is similarly reviewed by each co-player. Participants complete 6 rounds of "voting," during which they vote whether to "keep" or "kick out" each co-player, and following each vote receive feedback as to whether that co-player voted to accept ("keep") or reject ("kick out") them (Figure 1A). After each round, participants are told that one of the co-players had been sent out, and after completing the sixth round, participants are informed that they made it to the "Big Island." Participants receive 51 trials of feedback: 25 acceptance and 25 rejection, and one randomly selected trial---a unique strength of this particular task (over tasks of only social rejection or exclusion) that yields measurements of brain activity to social acceptance and rejection feedback. Co-players are randomly assigned a voting pattern for each participant such that 2 co-players reject the participant on most rounds, 2 co-players accept the participant on most rounds, and the remaining 7 co-players are equally likely to accept or reject the participant. Following the task, participants complete a brief post-task questionnaire assessing engagement in the task. This task has been validated in early adolescent, late adolescent, and young adult samples [@ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017; @ethridgePsychometricPropertiesNeural2018; @kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019]. 

Measurements of participants voting behavior can also be extracted. Voting behavior was computed two ways. First, the total number of votes cast to "keep" a co-player was summed and divided by the total number of votes cast by the participant. Second, the total number of votes cast to "keep" a co-player that had voted to accept the participant in the prior round were summed and divided by the total number of votes cast by the participant.

### 2.3.2 Behavioral reward bias and loss avoidance task
```{r}
load(here("../data/DISS_splithalf_pilt.RData"))

cor_rewardbias <- cor(splithalf_p$Reward_bias_20_1, splithalf_p$Reward_bias_20_2, method="pearson")
cor_lossbias <- cor(splithalf_n$Loss_bias_20_1, splithalf_n$Loss_bias_20_2, method="pearson")
```

To measure reward bias and loss avoidance we used the Probabilistic Incentive Learning Task (PILT), specifically two modified versions [@heereyDecisionMakingImpairmentsContext2008; @pizzagalliObjectiveCharacterizationAnhedonic2005], here termed PILT-Positive and PILT-Negative, to assess reward bias and loss avoidance respectively. These tasks have been used in adult and pediatric samples [@heereyDecisionMakingImpairmentsContext2008; @lukingChildGainApproach2015; @lukingLossesLoomLarger2016; @lukingReducedHedonicCapacity2015; @pizzagalliObjectiveCharacterizationAnhedonic2005; @pizzagalliReducedHedonicCapacity2008]. In each trial, participants perform a perceptual discrimination and indicate whether a long or short stimulus was briefly presented (Figure 1B). For the PILT-P, a portion of correct responses receive gain feedback while, for the PILT-N, a portion of incorrect responses receive loss feedback. For both tasks, one of the two responses (i.e., short or long, termed the RICH response) is scheduled to receive three times the amount of feedback as the alternative (LEAN) response. This leads to preferentially selecting the RICH response in the PILT-P (reward bias) and avoiding the RICH response in the PILT-N [loss avoidance, @lukingChildGainApproach2015; @lukingReducedHedonicCapacity2015; @pizzagalliObjectiveCharacterizationAnhedonic2005; @pizzagalliReducedHedonicCapacity2008]. Participants won 5 cents for gain feedback or lost 5 cents from a $7.00 endowment for loss feedback. At the end of the task, participants received their corresponding gains and remaining endowment.

Participants complete 20 practice trials, followed by two blocks of 60 trials each. Feedback was presented in a pseudo-random order, so that no more than three trials in a row could receive feedback. As in prior studies, individual trials with reaction times (RT) faster than 150ms or slower than 2500ms, or greater than or less than 3 standard deviations from the participant's mean RT were excluded. Response bias (log b) assesses behavioral responsiveness to feedback. Responses were coded such that more positive values on the PILT-P task indicate a greater propensity to select the RICH (i.e., rewarded) stimulus and more positive values on the PILT-N task indicate a greater propensity to select the LEAN (i.e., non-punished) stimulus. Per prior studies, 0.5 was added to each cell (i.e., $Rich_{correct}$, $Lean_{incorrect}$, $Rich_{incorrect}$, $Lean_{correct}$) to account for cases when one of these cells was zero [@hautusCorrectionsExtremeProportions1995; @pizzagalliReducedHedonicCapacity2008]. Spearman-Brown prediction formula split-half reliability was `r round((2*cor_rewardbias)/(1+cor_rewardbias),2)` for reward bias and `r round((2*cor_lossbias)/(1+cor_lossbias),2)` for loss avoidance.

<!-- $$ Reward~bias/Loss~avoidance~(logb) = \frac{1}{2}log\frac{Rich_{correct}*Lean_{incorrect}}{Rich_{incorrect}*Lean_{correct}} $$ -->

### 2.3.3 EEG Acquisition and Processing

Continuous EEG was recorded using the BrainVision ActiChamp, 32 channel active channel amplifier system (BrainVision LLC, Morrisville, NC, USA). Electrodes were mounted in an elastic cap using a subset of the International 10/20 System sites (FP1, F3, F7, FC1, FC5, FT9, C3, T7, CP1, CP5, TP9, P3, P7, O1, Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, FP2, F4, F8, FC2, FC6, FT10, C4, T8, CP2, CP6, P4, P8, TP10, O2), with a ground electrode located at FPz. The electrooculogram (EOG) generated from blinks and eye movements was recorded from five facial electrodes (locations depicted in Supplemental Materials, Figure S2). The EEG was sampled at 500 Hz and all signals digitized on a computer. All data was re-referenced to the average of Tp9 and Tp10 and band-pass filtered using an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, specifically a zero phase shift Butterworth filter from 0.1 with a 12 dB/oct slope to 30 Hz with a 24 dB/oct slope. The EEG was corrected for EOG artifacts [@grattonNewMethodOffline1983] and physiological artifacts removed using an automatic procedure with a maximum allowed voltage step of 50 µV within a 400 ms interval length, maximum absolute difference between any two points of 175 µV, and a minimum allowed activity of 0.50 µV within a 100 ms interval length. The EEG was segmented into 1000 ms epochs, beginning 200 ms before and ending 800 ms after feedback onset. ERPs were averaged for acceptance and rejection feedback, and baseline corrected to activity 200 ms prior to feedback.

## 2.4 Data Analysis

Data analysis plans were preregistered following data collection but prior to data analysis (osf.io/x8rdh). Those analyses that were not preregistered are included in the exploratory analyses section of the results. Code for analyses is available in the same OSF repository.

### 2.4.1 Multivariate outliers

Mahalanobis distance was calculated among all measures used in confirmatory analyses (i.e., RewP, FN, reward bias, loss avoidance, depression severity, social anxiety severity) and used to identify and exclude multivariate outliers with a threshold of $p$\<0.001 ($N$ = `r length(rows_to_exclude)`). This resulted in a final sample of $N$ = `r length(DISS_do02_nooutliers$Subid)`.

### 2.4.2 PCA

```

Temporospatial principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted with the EP Toolkit [@dienERPPCAToolkit2010] and data from all 117 participants with usable ERP data. A temporal PCA was conducted first, using a Promax rotation to rotate a simple structure in the temporal domain [@dienApplyingPrincipalComponents2012; @dienEvaluatingTwostepPCA2010; @dienEvaluationPCAICA2007] and included time points from each participant's averaged data as variables and participants, recording sites, and trial types as observations. To identify factors accounting for substantial variance, a Scree plot [@cattellScreeTestNumber1966] was generated and a parallel test [@hornRationaleTestNumber1965] conducted comparing a Scree of the dataset to that of a fully random dataset. We identified 15 temporal factors (TF) that accounted for a larger proportion of variance than the random dataset, and thus were retained. Next, a spatial PCA was conducted using Infomax rotation to rotate the spatial factors to independence [@dienEvaluatingTwostepPCA2010] and included all recordings sites as variables and participants, trial types, and temporal factor scores as observations. We identified 3 spatial factors (SF), resulting in 45 factor combinations accounting for a total 34.8% of the variance. Factor scores were converted to voltages and robust analysis of variance was conducted on factors that accounted for greater than 1% of variance to identify those that meaningfully distinguished acceptance and rejection feedback, yielding 11 factors. Peak latency and electrode location were used to identify the component most consistent with RewP and FN at TF 2–SF 1 (TF2/SF1). Data was imported from Brain Vision Analyzer to R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020] for all further computations.

ERP activity in this component significantly differed between the acceptance and rejection conditions (`r apa_print(rewp_ttest, in_paren=TRUE)$full_result`). This component's peak latency (344ms), frontocentral peak electrode (FC2), and amount of variance accounted for (6.27%) were all similar to RewP/FN components identified using PCA in prior studies [@peggTimeCourseReactivity2022; @ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017; @freemanNeuralResponseRewarding2022; @kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017]. The RewP was calculated as the mean amplitude 50ms before and 50ms after the PCA-identified peak (344ms, time window of 294-394ms) at the peak electrode (FC2; Figure 2B) in order to keep it consistent with prior studies which have used a mean amplitude approach and to measure split-half reliability. The RewP was calculated as the mean activity 50ms before and 50ms after the PCA-identified peak (344ms, time window of 294-394ms) at the peak electrode (FC2; Figure 2B). In line with previous work and recommendations  [@meyerConsideringERPDifference2017], residual scores for the RewP (RewP~resid~) response to acceptance accounting for the response to rejection were calculated, producing scores uncorrelated with the response to rejection. Likewise, residual scores for the FN (FN~resid~) response to rejection accounting for the response to acceptance were calculated, producing scores uncorrelated with the response to acceptance. This produces RewP~resid~ and FN~resid~ scores that are highly correlated ($r$ = `r myround(rewp_fn_cor$estimate, 2)`) but *not inverses* of one another and isolates mean amplitude in the ERP unique to acceptance or rejection. Thus, the RewP~resid~ can be conceptualized as a participant's response to acceptance, and the FN~resid~ as a participant's response to rejection. Although we could have used a non-difference score of response to acceptance or rejection (e.g., mean amplitude to acceptance without accounting for activity to rejection), this would have been confounded by activity throughout the brain unrelated to the acceptance stimulus.

Results of the PCA also suggested the presence of components consistent with P2 and N1, both of which also significantly differed between the acceptance and rejection conditions (P2: `r apa_print(p2_ttest)$full_result`; N1: `r apa_print(n1_ttest)$full_result`). The P2 and N1 were calculated as the mean activity 50ms before and 50ms after the PCA-identified peak at the peak electrode (P2: peak latency 212ms, time window of 162-262ms at Cz electrode; N1: PCA-identified peak 174ms, time window of 124-224ms at Cz electrode; Figure 2D. The P2 was calculated as the residualized responses to acceptance accounting for the response to rejection. The N1 was calculated as the residualized responses to rejection accounting for the response to acceptance. Of note, we did not identify a component consistent with a P300 component that differentiated acceptance vs. rejection. However, this is consistent with prior PCAs where the P300 appears to be enhanced to both [@peggTimeCourseReactivity2022].

The split-half reliability (as estimated by the Spearman-Brown prediction formula) of ERP responses to acceptance at the FC2 electrode for the 294-394ms time window was `r round((2*acc_cor)/(1+acc_cor),2)` and to rejection was `r round((2*rej_cor)/(1+rej_cor),2)`. The split-half reliability of the residualized RewP~resid~ was `r round((2*rewp_cor)/(1+rewp_cor),2)` and the FN~resid~ was `r round((2*fn_cor)/(1+fn_cor),2)`, which is comparable to prior studies [@ethridgePsychometricPropertiesNeural2018; @levinsonReliabilityElectrocorticalResponse2017a].

To supplement analyses, we also computed the RewP~resid~ and FN~resid~ using two a priori time windows based on the literature, 250-350ms and 275-375ms, as well as the PCA factor scores converted to microvolt scaling. Doing so will further assure that results are not dependant upon the ERP scoring method.

### 2.4.3 Multiple imputation of missing data

MCAR analyses showed that there was not significant evidence to reject the hypothesis that the variables of interest (i.e., depression severity, social anxiety severity, reward positivity, feedback negativity, reward bias, and loss avoidance, and covariates [age, sex, SES, race, ethnicity]) were missing completely at random (MCAR; $p$ = `r mean(MCAR_test$pnormality)`). `r sum(is.na(DISS_do02$Reward_bias_20))` had missing data for the behavioral reward task and `r sum(is.na(DISS_do02$Loss_bias_20))` for the loss task, `r sum(is.na(DISS_do02$S5cdic_bdi_perc))` had missing data for depression severity, and there was no missing data for social anxiety severity. There was no missing data for the covariates, except for psychotropic medication use, which `r sum(is.na(DISS_do02$S5psychmed_dos_f))` subjects were missing. Multiple imputation was conducted using the 'MICE' package [@vanbuurenMiceMultivariateImputation2011] in R. Ten imputations were generated using predictive mean matching of the variables of interest and covariates, and other measures that were collected concurrently and a priori considered to inform missing data in depression severity (e.g., major depressive disorder diagnosis on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia [K-SADS], social anxiety disorder diagnosis on the K-SADS, behavioral approach system [BAS] child drive, BAS child fun seeking, BAS child reward responsiveness--revised, behavioral inhibition system [BIS] child--revised, and the Pleasure Scale for Children) and behavioral reward bias/loss avoidance (accuracy on the PILT-P and PILT-N, National Institutes of Health Toolbox list sorting, pattern completion, picture sequencing, picture vocabulary, flanker). Of note, psychotropic medication use was not imputed.

### 2.4.4 Multiple regression models

Following multiple imputation, measures were standardized in each of the 10 imputations. Multiple regression models were conducted and estimates were pooled across the imputations using the 'miceadds' package [@miceadds_3.10-28].

Multiple regression models were used to test all three primary hypotheses. For example, two models tested the first hypothesis. In one model, reward bias and loss avoidance were included as predictors, along with covariates, and the RewP~resid~ as the outcome (see equation 1 below). The other model included the same predictors but included the FN~resid~ as the outcome (see equation 2 below). These models allow for estimation of the amount of unique variance in the ERP component activity accounted for by reward bias and loss avoidance, controlling for covariates.

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
[1] ~ RewP~resid~=b_{0}+b_{1}Reward~bias+b_{2}Loss~Avoidance+b_{3}Age+\\
b_{4}Income~to~needs~ratio+b_{5}Sex+b_{6}Race_{1}+b_{7}Race_{2}+b_{8}Hispanic 
\end{aligned}
$$ 
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
[2] ~ FN~resid~=b_{0}+b_{1}Reward~bias+b_{2}Loss~Avoidance+b_{3}Age+\\ b_{4}Income~to~needs~ratio+b_{5}Sex+b_{6}Race_{1}+b_{7}Race_{2}+b_{8}Hispanic
\end{aligned}
$$ 

An identical structure was used to test the second and third hypotheses. That is, in models testing the second hypothesis, depression and social anxiety severity were included as predictors and the RewP~resid~ as the outcome in the first model, and the FN~resid~ as the outcome in the second model. The RewP~resid~ and FN~resid~ were not included in any models as simultaneous predictors due to multicollinearity concerns. In models testing the third hypothesis, depression and social anxiety severity were included as predictors and reward bias as the outcome in the first model, and loss avoidance as the outcome in the second model. Finally, exploratory Bayesian estimation and Bayes Factor analyses were conducted when a relevant prior was present in the extant literature, to guard against potential Type II (false negative) errors.

### 2.4.5 Structural equation model of hypotheses

A structural equation model (SEM) of all three hypotheses was modeled using the 'lavaan' package version `r packageVersion("lavaan")` [@rosseelLavaanPackageStructural2012a] to determine whether the hypotheses demonstrated an overall improvement in model fit over a null model (i.e., one that assumed that all of the hypothesized relationships were null). By simultaneously testing the predicted associations between all variables, this model accounted for within-subject shared variance across, for example, ERP components (i.e., RewP~resid~ & FN~resid~), while testing its predicted associations with reward bias and loss avoidance and with the psychopathology measures. Model fit was assessed two ways. First, measures of absolute model fit---root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)---were compared to established guidelines (RMSEA & SRMR \< 0.08) to determine goodness of fit [@hooperStructuralEquationModelling2008]. Second, measures of relative model fit---chi-square difference ($\Delta$$\chi^{2}$) test, comparative fit index (CFI), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC)---were compared to a reduced model [with higher CFI and lower AIC and BIC indicating better model fit, @hooperStructuralEquationModelling2008].

```

Multiple regression models showed that the RewP~resid~ to social acceptance feedback was not significantly associated with behavioral reward bias, nor was the FN~resid~ to social rejection significantly associated with behavioral loss avoidance (Table 3). Zero order correlations further confirmed this pattern of results (Table 2). Results from supplemental analyses including recent psychotropic medication use were consistent (Table S3). Results using a priori time windows (250-350ms, 275-375ms) and voltage converted factor scores were also consistent (Table S7, S8, S9).

Multiple regression models showed that the RewP~resid~ to social acceptance feedback was not significantly associated with depression severity, nor was the FN~resid~ to social rejection feedback significantly associated with depression or social anxiety severity (Table 3). Zero order correlations further confirmed this pattern of results (Table 2), however, the effect size of the correlation between the RewP~resid~ and depression severity ($r$ = `r myround(rewp_dep_lm[2,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r rewp_dep_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(rewp_dep_lm[2,]$p.value,2)`) was comparable to three large prior studies using independent samples [$r_{pooled}$ = `r myround(pooled_r,2)`, total $N_{pooled}$ = `r sum(prior_data$N)`, @kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019; @peggAlteredRewardResponsiveness2021]. Results from supplemental analyses including recent psychotropic medication use were consistent (Table S3). Results using a priori time windows (250-350ms, 275-375ms) and voltage converted factor scores were also consistent (Table S7, S8, S9).

f1_BF <- bayesfactor_parameters(posterior=f1_new, null=0, prior=f1_un, seed=314)
```

Bayesian analyses were used to test for the strength of the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis given the presence of a null effect and availability of an informed prior [@kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019; @peggAlteredRewardResponsiveness2021]. The relative standard error was estimated using the pooled sample size of the three studies ($N$ = `r sum(prior_data$N)`) and correlation of $r$ = `r myround(pooled_r,2)`, and was included as the standard deviation of the prior for all analyses. Thus, the Bayesian linear regression with an informed prior of `r myround(pooled_r,2)` (standard deviation `r myround(pooled_rse,3)`) showed a similar estimate to the results above ($\beta$ = `r myround(fixef(f1_new)[2,1],2)`, 95% CI [`r f1_ci`]) and resulted in a Bayes Factor of `r myround(exp(f1_BF$log_BF)[2],2)`, suggesting anecdotal support for the alternative hypothesis [@wetzelsStatisticalEvidenceExperimental2011].

### 3.1.3 Association between Reward bias/loss avoidance and depression and social anxiety severity

Multiple regression models showed that reward bias was not significantly associated with depression severity, nor was loss avoidance significantly associated with depression or social anxiety severity (Table 4).

Structural equation models, modeling all hypotheses simultaneously, supported the pattern of results reported above (Figure S1). The hypothesized model showed good fit according to absolute model fit indices and CFI (RMSEA=`r myround(fitm_full[5],2)`, SRMR=`r myround(fitm_full[6],2)`, CFI=`r myround(fitm_full[4],2)`), but it did not show significant improvement in model fit over the simplified null model (Table S1).

Multiple regression models showed that income-to-needs ratio was significantly positively associated with the RewP~resid~ (not the FN~resid~) when reward bias and loss avoidance were included as predictors ($\beta$ = `r myround(mr.rewp_pilt_ci[9,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r rewp_pilt_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(mr.rewp_pilt_ci[9,]$p.value,2)`), and that the association was trending when current depression and social anxiety severity were included as predictors ($\beta$ = `r myround(mr.rewp_sym_ci[9,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r rewp_sym_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(mr.rewp_sym_ci[9,]$p.value,2)`; Table 3). Results using a priori time windows (250-350ms, 275-375ms) and voltage converted factor scores were also consistent (Table S7, S8, S9).

Follow up analyses showed that income-to-needs was indeed positively associated with the RewP~resid~, and not the FN~resid~, in zero-order correlations (Figure 3; RewP~resid~: $r$ = `r myround(rewp_I2N[2,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r rewp_I2N_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(rewp_I2N[2,]$p.value,2)`; FN~resid~: $r$ = `r myround(fn_I2N[2,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r fn_I2N_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(fn_I2N[2,]$p.value,2)`). Because 1) income-to-needs significantly differed between races in our sample ($F$(`r I2N_race$df[1]`,`r I2N_race$df[2]`) = `r myround(I2N_race$statistic[1],2)`, $p$\<.001) and 2) there has been recent discussion in the field about the imperfectness of reports on participants' race in identifying risk factors and equity gaps [@ioannidisRecalibratingUseRace2021], we also examined models in which race was omitted as a covariate. In these models, income-to-needs was significantly positively associated with the RewP~resid~ covarying for reward bias, loss avoidance, depression severity, and social anxiety severity ($\beta$ = `r myround(mr.rewp_ci_norace[9,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r rewp_ci_norace`], $p$ `r myround2(mr.rewp_ci_norace[9,]$p.value,2)`).

Multiple regression models also showed that income-to-needs was significantly positively associated with behavioral reward bias ($\beta$ = `r myround(mr.rb_sym_ci[9,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r rb_sym_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(mr.rb_sym_ci[9,]$p.value,2)`) and significantly negatively associated with loss avoidance ($\beta$ = `r myround(mr.la_sym_ci[9,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r la_sym_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(mr.la_sym_ci[9,]$p.value,2)`) (Table 4). That is, reduced income-to-needs ratio was related to reduced bias towards rewarding stimuli and greater avoidance of the punished response. Zero order correlations further confirmed a significant association with loss avoidance ($r$ = `r myround(la_i2n_lm[2,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r la_i2n_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(la_i2n_lm[2,]$p.value,2)`), but not reward bias ($r$ = `r myround(rb_i2n_lm[2,]$estimate,2)`, 95% CI [`r rb_i2n_ci`], $p$ `r myround2(rb_i2n_lm[2,]$p.value,2)`; Table 2) . These results were consistent when accuracy (i.e., participants' ability to correctly discriminate between the stimuli) and recent psychotropic medication use was included in the model, though at trend levels for the association with reward bias (Table S5).

```

We also conducted exploratory analyses examining the other ERP components. The temporospatial PCA yielded one component similar to the P2 and one similar to the N1. Exploratory analyses revealed that neither the P2 nor N1 were significantly associated with reward bias or loss avoidance, nor with depression or social anxiety severity (Table S6).

Analyses of voting behavior was conducted as an additional exploratory analysis following previous studies using the Island Getaway task that have detected effects in voting behavior [@peggTimeCourseReactivity2022;@rappaportPeerVictimizationDysfunctional2019; @schellHungerGamesAssociations2021; @weinbergNeuralResponsesSocial2021]. Neither brain responses to acceptance (RewP~resid~) nor rejection (FN~resid~) were significantly related to voting behavior. This was true when assessing proportion of all votes cast to keep co-players (RewP~resid~: $\beta$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop_z ~ rewp_r_z, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$estimate[2],2)`, $p$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop_z ~ rewp_r_z, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$p.value[2],2)`; FN~resid~: $\beta$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop_z ~ fn_r_z, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$estimate[2],2)`, $p$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop ~ fn_r, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$p.value[2],2)`), and proportion of votes cast to keep co-players that had voted to keep the participant in the previous round of voting/feedback (RewP~resid~: $\beta$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop_pr_z ~ rewp_r_z, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$estimate[2],2)`, $p$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop_pr_z ~ rewp_r_z, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$p.value[2],2)`; FN~resid~: $\beta$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop_pr_z ~ rewp_r_z, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$estimate[2],2)`, $p$ = `r round(tidy(lm(Keep_prop_pr_z ~ fn_r, DISS_do02_full_nooutliers))$p.value[2],2)`). Furthermore, neither type of voting behavior was significantly related to other variables of interest, including depression, social anxiety, reward bias, and loss avoidance (see Supplemental Materials).

# 4. Discussion
As the first to assess the relationship between ERP responses to social feedback and behavioral performance on reward/loss tasks, the current study sought to test hypotheses that a) the RewP~resid~ and FN~resid~ ERP components observed in response to social feedback reflect reward and loss system function respectively, b) depression and social anxiety have shared and distinct mechanisms of interpersonal relationship problems, and c) that depression and social anxiety have shared and distinct mechanisms of dysfunction in responding to rewards and losses.

We did not find significant associations between the RewP~resid~ and behavioral reward bias, and the FN~resid~ and behavioral loss avoidance. Given the null finding, and thus need for further replication, we caution against interpreting this as  evidence that the RewP~resid~ and FN~resid~ to social feedback do not use or reflect the same reward and loss related processes shown in monetary reward tasks. One prior study found a weak but non-significant relationship between brain responses to social and monetary rewards (i.e., RewP~resid~) in emerging adults ($r$(46) = 0.16, $p$ = 0.27) and early adolescents [$r$(37) = 0.28, $p$ = 0.09, @ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017], and a subset of the current sample showed weak but non-significant correlations as well [$r$(54) = 0.04, $p$ = 0.76, unpublished data, see @rappaportPeerVictimizationDysfunctional2019 for methods]. However, different structures of social reward tasks have led to a more strongly correlated social and monetary RewP~resid~  [@distefanoComparisonElectrocorticalResponse2018; @nelsonNeuralResponseMonetary2021]. However, evidence from large-scale brain-wide association studies suggests that, though non-significant, this effect size is well within the range of a true brain-behavior effect size [$r$ = 0.11-0.14; @marekReproducibleBrainwideAssociation2022].

Importantly, the results of hypothesis 1 should be considered in light of the potential effect of multi-method and task-related variance. This hypothesis relied on testing the convergence between individual differences in brain responses and behavioral performance on two separate tasks. Therefore, we do not know whether method or task differences obscured a true relationship. As prior studies have done [e.g., @distefanoComparisonElectrocorticalResponse2018], future studies are needed testing convergence between brain and behavioral measures on the same methods, and on the same or very similar tasks. For example, behavioral measures of social feedback may better map onto the behavioral measures of reward and loss, and brain measures of social feedback may better map onto brain measures of response to reward and loss. Together these results will help establish the conditions under which brain responses to social and other types of feedback are similar and different. Moreover, we are most excited at the prospect of multi-method (e.g., behavioral, neuroimaging, psychophysiological) and multi-task studies (i.e., that use multiple tasks assessing reward responding) being able to inform the extent to which task and method variability affect relationships with psychopathology. The current study informs how domain general the brain's response to social feedback is compared to other kinds of feedback.

A theoretical explanation for the lack of correspondence between the RewP~resid~ or FN~resid~ and behavioral social reward bias/loss avoidance is that there are a number of psychological processes that occur when one experiences social feedback, with the reward or loss system as just one of those processes. These more complex processes may obscure our ability to detect the “pure” reward- or loss-relevant brain signal. For example, one review proposed that there is a period of attentional orienting to the feedback, followed by the emotional appraisal of the feedback, and finally resulting in emotion regulation [@wangHowBrainReacts2017]. Such theories are supported by the presence of different ERP components identified in the current study (i.e., N1, P2, RewP~resid~, FN~resid~), and another review supporting the presence of multiple processes in response to rewards [@glazerFRNBroadeningTimecourse2018]. However, the N1 and P2 emerge even in simple visual tasks that require little if any emotional responses, regulation, or appraisal [@serenoEstablishingTimelineWord1998]. Thus, future studies will need to assess the relationship between these brain signals and converging behaviors to better determine their function.

## 4.2 Brain responses to social feedback and depression and social anxiety severity

We did not find support for significant relationships between the RewP~resid~ and FN~resid~ and concurrent depression and social anxiety symptoms. One possibility is that blunted RewP~resid~ and heightened FN~resid~ responses may reflect risk factors for future depression and/or social anxiety [@kujawaVulnerabilityDepressionYouth2017; @mastenSubgenualAnteriorCingulate2011] rather than indicators of a current depressive or socially anxious state. This risk may interact with enviornmental stressors to give rise to psychopathology, as in prospective studies where the RewP~resid~ interacts with stressful life events to predict later depression [@buraniNeuralResponseRewards2021; @goldsteinStressfulLifeEvents2020; @mackinRewardProcessingFuture2019; @olinoSocialRewardYouth2015; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019]. Moreover, the clinical literature supports different forms of social rejection (e.g., peer victimization, romantic breakups, parental rejection) as risk factors for depression [@copelandAdultPsychiatricOutcomes2013; @kendlerLifeEventDimensions2003; @monroeLifeEventsDepression1999; @rapeePotentialRoleChildrearing1997; @slavichTargetedRejectionPredicts2009] and social anxiety [@mooreConsequencesBullyingVictimization2017; @pickardNavigatingSocialWorld2018; @reijntjesPeerVictimizationInternalizing2010; @storchPeerVictimizationSocial2005]. Therefore, greater sensitivity (i.e., heightened FN~resid~) to rejection, in combination with greater experiences of interpersonal rejection, may lead to depression and/or social anxiety.

## 4.3 Reward bias and loss avoidance and depression and social anxiety severity

Finally, we did not find that depression nor social anxiety severity were related to behavioral reward bias or loss avoidance. This was surprising given previous evidence that these constructs are affected, particularly in depression [@lukingChildGainApproach2015; @lukingReducedHedonicCapacity2015; @pizzagalliReducedHedonicCapacity2008; @vriezeReducedRewardLearning2013; @whittonBluntedNeuralResponses2016]. One possibility is that the prior literature may reflect false positives. Another is that rather than being related cross-sectionally to depression or social anxiety severity, impaired reward processing may be more of a trait associated with risk of future psychopathology. This is supported by studies showing that history of depression is related to impaired reward processing [@pechtelBluntedRewardResponsiveness2013; @rappaportBrainRewardSystem2020], history of social anxiety is related to enhanced reactivity to losses [@kesselNeuralReactivityMonetary2015], and that reward processing dysfunction predicts depressive symptoms [@gotlibNeuralProcessingReward2010; @lukingDepressionRiskPredicts2016; @mccabeNeuralProcessingReward2012; @stringarisBrainResponseReward2015]. Although the PDS study includes data about past psychopathology of the current sample, we were concerned that such exploratory analyses would require too many comparisons. Further, past assessments of social anxiety in the study are limited, since the SIAS/SPS was not collected prior to the current wave.

## 4.4 Socioeconomic status and brain response to social acceptance

The results also suggest some interesting avenues for further exploration. We had not predicted a priori that SES (as operationalized as income-to-needs ratio) would be associated with the RewP~resid~ and FN~resid~. In fact, the only prior literature we are aware of would suggest that lower SES might be associated with increased reward learning and brain responses to monetary rewards  [@toblerLearningRelatedHumanBrain2007], with no evidence to inform these relationships to social feedback. However, theories of threat and deprivation would suggest that, as we found, lower SES is associated with reduced reward response [@mclaughlinCumulativeRiskDimensional2016]. Specifically, studies have shown that food insecurity is associated with fewer rewards earned on a behavioral task [@dennisonDifferentialAssociationsDistinct2019], and blunted striatal development—a brain structure key in responding to rewards [@hansonBluntedVentralStriatum2015]. We chose to include SES in the multiple regression models to control for the established relationship between income-to-needs and psychopathology [@barchEffectHippocampalAmygdala2016; @gilmanSocioeconomicStatusChildhood2002]. Thus, it is intriguing that we found a positive relationship between SES and RewP~resid~ to social feedback. We are not aware of any prior literature examining relationships between SES and brain response to social feedback, making this a highly novel finding. There is robust literature indicating that low SES is related to greater risk for psychopathology [@leungPovertyAdolescentDevelopmental2011; @lorantSocioeconomicInequalitiesDepression2003; @peverillSocioeconomicStatusChild2021]. Given that lower SES was associated with a reduced RewP~resid~ to positive social feedback, one possibility is that poverty confers risk for psychopathology at least partially through social anhedonia. This could lead to social withdrawal and greater social isolation—which is already exacerbated in impoverished youth [@eckhardDoesPovertyIncrease2018; @slettenSocialCostsPoverty2010]---and subsequently depression [@bruceSocialPhysicalHealth1994]. If blunted responses to social acceptance is in fact a risk factor for future depression, then this illustrates a potential causal pathway whereby poverty leads to blunted responses to social acceptance, which in turn leads to depression. However, since this is an exploratory finding, replication is necessary to support such propositions.

## 4.5 Socioeconomic status and behavioral reward bias and loss avoidance

Another novel finding was that lower SES was associated with less behavioral reward bias and greater loss avoidance on the PILT (with a larger effect size for the latter). That is, the lower the SES of the adolescent's family, the less they were biased towards the rewarded response, and the more they were biased away from the punished response. This represents another intriguing potential pathway through which poverty confers risk for psychopathology. Adolescents with fewer monetary resources, who likely experience increased social rejection, may be more sensitive to loss. That is, adolescents with lower SES may seek to avoid potential losses. This shift towards avoidance of negative reinforcements may come at the expense of positive reinforcements. Moreover, an enhanced response to losses has been associated with depression risk [@lukingChildGainApproach2015; @lukingDepressionRiskPredicts2016], and depression is associated with a focus on reducing negative reinforcement at the cost of potential positive reinforcements [for a review of how this is targeted in psychotherapy see @dimidjianOriginsCurrentStatus2011]. Thus, if lower SES is associated with greater sensitivity to loss and a blunted response to reward, this could confer risk for developing depression. If these findings are replicated, future studies should examine the mechanisms responsible for and the outcomes of the link between poverty, blunted responses to social acceptance, and blunted reward bias and enhanced loss avoidance.

## 4.6 Strengths and limitations

This study represents an important step in our understanding of the function of the brain's response to social feedback, and how that function is different in depression and social anxiety. The current study has a number of strengths, including a) the preregistration of hypotheses and analyses (osf.io/x8rdh), b) use of dimensional measures of depression and social anxiety, and c) robust multiple regression and structural equation modeling analyses that include demographic covariates, including SES. Moreover, this study provides intriguing exploratory findings that could have implications for our understanding of how poverty affects processing of social acceptance feedback.

These strengths must also be considered in light of the current study's limitations. First, as discussed above, we do not know the extent to which the findings of hypothesis 1 were affected by method or task-related differences. It is possible that the Island Getaway and PILT tasks tap into two separate psychological processes which both involve the reward system. To detect this, further studies comparing reward responses to social and monetary rewards that adjust only one aspect (i.e. the feedback) are needed. In fact one study that did so found very similar brain responses [@distefanoComparisonElectrocorticalResponse2018; @nelsonNeuralResponseMonetary2021]. By comparing individual differences across two methodologies (ERP, behavior) and tasks (IG and PILT), the current study sought to test the robustness of this correspondence. Despite this substantial limitation, it is our hope that these findings, together with prior findings [@distefanoComparisonElectrocorticalResponse2018; @ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017; @nelsonNeuralResponseMonetary2021], inform factors that affect the correspondence between responses to monetary and social rewards. Second, our study may have been under-powered to detect the hypothesized relationships. Power analyses suggested that the sample ($N$ = `r length(DISS_do02_nooutliers$Subid)`) has `r round(MR_power$power[1],2)*100`% power to detect moderate effects ($f^2$ = `r myround(MR_power$f2[1],2)`), and `r round(MR_power$power[2],2)*100`% power to detect smaller effects ($f^2$ = `r myround(MR_power$f2[2],2)`), at an alpha of 0.05 with `r english(MR_power$p1-MR_power$p2)` predictors of interest and `r english(MR_power$p2)` covariates in the multiple regression. However, we were under-powered to detect a correlation between the RewP~resid~ to social acceptance and depression severity at the effect size found in three prior studies [$r$ = `r myround(pooled_r,2)`, @kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017; @peggBluntedSocialReward2019]. That being said, finding a similar effect size among *four* independent studies of adolescents---one of which was preregistered---suggests that this may represent a true population effect albeit of small magnitude. Third, one may take issue with our use of multiple regressions as overly conservative. To guard against potential Type II error, we also examined zero-order correlations between the variables of interest. These correlations largely converged with the results of the regression models. Fourth, convergence of the current findings with studies using other behavioral measures of reward and loss are needed to verify whether or not these ERP components truly represent engagement of reward and loss systems. Fifth, though the characteristics of the social feedback task in the current study optimize ecological validity, this may result in confounding ERP components that could obscure the response of the brain's subcortical reward system. Comparisons with monetary reward ERP tasks suggest that the brain's response to social feedback may be more complex than its response to monetary feedback [e.g., @ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017]. This presents an intriguing direction for future research: identifying the ERP components and corresponding psychological processes present in response to social acceptance and rejection. Sixth, subcortical processing of social feedback may be affected in depression and social anxiety. Although ERP measures may be able to detect downstream consequences in cortical regions [e.g., insula, cortical networks, @rappaportBrainResponsesSocial2020], they would not be able to detect the subcortical origins of such individual differences [e.g., in the subgenual ACC or striatum,  @silkIncreasedNeuralResponse2014]. FMRI however carries its own limitations. The low temporal resolution of fMRI would limit the ability to distinguish between the different processes thought to underlie the response to social feedback. Future studies using both ERP and fMRI methods will be able to address this. Seventh, residualized ERP scores demonstrated worse split-half reliability than the non-residualized scores. Thus, much larger sample sizes may be needed to detect relationships with the PILT and with symptom measures. Eight, it is possible that the PCA component we identified here as the RewP~resid~/FN~resid~ better reflects a P300 component or some combination of the two. We believe that this component is most consistent with RewP~resid~/FN~resid~ because (1) prior studies using PCA consistently identify a later RewP~resid~/FN~resid~ to social feedback compared to monetary rewards and losses (e.g., 297-356ms, 344ms in the current study)  [@peggTimeCourseReactivity2022; @ethridgeNeuralResponsesSocial2017; @freemanNeuralResponseRewarding2022; @kujawaSocialProcessingEarly2017]; (2) the P300 often accounts for a large amount of variance (e.g., 22.17%), while the RewP~resid~/FN~resid~ accounts for smaller portions of variance (e.g., 1.31-7.98% in prior studies, 6.27% in the current study); (3), because the P300 is thought to reflect salience or novelty [@goldsteinInfluenceStimulusDeviance2002; @pritchardPsychophysiologyP3001981], it may not significantly differ between acceptance and rejection as the RewP/FN identified component in the current study does. This is because there are an equal number of acceptance and rejection trials (making sure that one is no more novel than the other), and we expect both conditions to be equally salient, particularly among adolescents. Therefore, we would not necessarily expect this component to significantly differ between the two conditions. This is supported empirically by one study that included an additional neutral condition in the Island Getaway task showing that acceptance and rejection both elicited elevated P300s relative to neutral, but not different from one another, whereas the RewP/FN component was uniquely enhanced for acceptance [@peggTimeCourseReactivity2022]. (4) The scalp topography of the PCA-derived component in Figure 2 is more frontal, again more consistent with a RewP/FN than P300. Ninth, the Island Getaway task does require subjects to vote prior to recieving feedback, but the feedback is not directly tied to this action. Prior literature implicating the mesecephalic dopamine system suggests that this may be a necessary piece in eliciting a RewP~resid~ or FN~resid~. Moreover, the PILT task notably does have an action/choice tied immediately to feedback. Thus, we cannot be certain that this difference between the tasks, and aspect of the Island Getaway task specifically, did not at least partially contribute to the lack of correspondence between ERPs and behavioral performance on the PILT. Finally, we would also note that during a follow up study, a minor error was discovered in the task that is likely to affect the timing of the components. Specifically, trigger codes were sent 2-45ms before feedback appeared on the screen, resulting in artificially delayed ERPs. That is, the ERPs measured in the task actually present 2-45ms earlier in time than shown in the grand average waveform in Figure 2A. We emphasize, however, that analyses in an independent sample confirmed that this has a very minor effect on individual-differences analyses. Specifically, the RewP when calculated using the original timing is highly correlated with the RewP when calculated with the updated timing ($r$s > 0.96, $p$<0.001).

## 4.7 Conclusions

Overall, the current findings build on prior findings while also presenting exciting directions for future research. Although non-significant in the current study, the finding of a preregistered and consistent, albeit small, relationship between depression and brain response to social acceptance across now three independent studies is notable. Finally, the exploratory findings that lower SES is related to greater blunting of the brain response to social acceptance, enhanced loss avoidance and,---to a smaller extent---reduced behavioral reward bias, offers evidence of a potential novel mechanism linking poverty with psychopathology. Together these findings represent an important step in alleviating problems in interpersonal relationships.
